description: Legacy vs new architecture, facade, and current migration phases
alwaysApply: true

# Reimagine architecture

- **legacy** is the old codebase (`repos/legacy/`). **new** is the replacement stack (`repos/new/`).
- In new: **enterprise-web** is the new frontend. **enterprise-web-aggregator** is the facade.
- **enterprise-web** replaces **mercury** (legacy).
- **enterprise-web-aggregator** will eventually replace **apollo** (legacy). That Apollo replacement is **Phase 2**, not current work.
- Current work is adding the facade only. Do not treat Apollo replacement as in-scope until Phase 2.

## Phases

- **Phase 0** (current): internal release
- **Phase 1**: early adapters
- **Phase 2**: replace Apollo with enterprise-web-aggregator
